## H1 and H2

H1. Left-Right placement as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is positively associated with Left-Right placement as computed from responses to the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS). This association is stronger than any associations between the Left-Right and GAL-TAN dimensions.

H2. GAL-TAN placement as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is positively associated with GAL-TAN placement as computed from responses to the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS). This association is stronger than any associations between the Left-Right and GAL-TAN dimensions.

"

```

### Fitting the model

```{r}
fit_H1H2<-cfa(model=model_H1H2,
              data=dat2019,
              missing="fiml")

```

Some problems with latent variable covariance structure

```{r}
lavInspect(fit_H1H2, "cov.lv")
lavInspect(fit_H1H2, "cor.lv")


#examine standardized estimates
std.est_H1H2<-standardizedsolution(fit_H1H2)
std.est_H1H2[std.est_H1H2$op=="~~" & 
               std.est_H1H2$lhs!=std.est_H1H2$rhs,]



```

There is an impossible correlation between GAL-TAN latent variables (absolute value > 1)

\newpage

### Respecified model: introduce the three preregistered residual correlations

Add the terms to the model script

```{r}
model_H1H2.re<-paste0(model_H1H2,
                      "h27~~C2h\n",
                      "h21~~C2d\n",
                      "h29~~C2c\n")
```

### Fitting the respecified model

```{r}
fit_H1H2.re<-cfa(model=model_H1H2.re,
              data=dat2019,
              missing="fiml")

```

### Results

Inspect fit of the model (first is the original model with problems,
second is the respecified)

```{r}
round(inspect(fit_H1H2,"fit")
      [c("npar","df","chisq","pvalue","cfi","tli","rmsea","srmr")],3)

round(inspect(fit_H1H2.re,"fit")
      [c("npar","df","chisq","pvalue","cfi","tli","rmsea","srmr")],3)
```

The fit of the model is adequate.

Hypotheses 1 and 2

Print standardized estimates to test the difference between correlations

```{r}
std.est_H1H2<-standardizedsolution(fit_H1H2.re)
std.est_H1H2[std.est_H1H2$op==":=" | 
               std.est_H1H2$op=="~~" & 
               std.est_H1H2$lhs!=std.est_H1H2$rhs,]

#save to a file

           "../results/Table3_Overall_H1H2_standardized_estimates.xlsx",
       overwrite=T)
```

H1: There is very strong (.915, p < .001) correlation between VAA-LR and CS-LR, and it is notably stronger (difference in correlations .492, p < .001) than the strongest of correlations between different dimensions (.424 between VAA_LR and VAA_GT, p < .001)

H2: There is very strong (.990, p < .001) correlation between VAA-GT and CS-GT, and it is notably stronger (difference in correlations .566, p < .001) than the strongest of correlations between different dimensions (.424 between VAA_LR and VAA_GT, p < .001)

\newpage

### Exploratory analysis for H1 and H2: Seek misspecification to improve the overall model fit

Residual correlations

```{r}
mis.rescor_H1H2<-miPowerFit(fit_H1H2.re,cor=.20)
mis.rescor_H1H2<-mis.rescor_H1H2[mis.rescor_H1H2$op=="~~" & 
                                   mis.rescor_H1H2$lhs!=mis.rescor_H1H2$rhs,]
#see summary of the decisions
table(mis.rescor_H1H2$decision.pow)

#there are 1 residual correlation that is a misspecification

rounded.vars<-c("mi","epc","target.epc",
                "std.epc","se.epc")

num.round<-function(var){
  var<-as.numeric(var)
  var<-round(var,2)
  return(var)
}

mis.rescor_H1H2[,rounded.vars]<-
  sapply(mis.rescor_H1H2[,rounded.vars],num.round)

printed.vars<-c("lhs","op","rhs","mi","epc","target.epc",
                "std.epc","std.target.epc","significant.mi",
                "high.power","decision.pow","se.epc")

#print the output

mis.rescor_H1H2 %>%
  filter(mis.rescor_H1H2$decision.pow=="M" | 
                mis.rescor_H1H2$decision.pow=="EPC:M") %>%
  dplyr::select(all_of(printed.vars)) 

  
```

There was one misspecified residual correlation in VAA-LR, between
h25. Public services should be outsourced more than they are now for private companies and y19. Public authorities should be the main provider of social and healthcare services (r.) 

### Exploratory respecification of the model

Add new parameter to the model script

```{r}
model_H1H2.exp.re<-paste0(model_H1H2.re,
                      "h25~~y19")

```

### Fitting the exploratory model

```{r}
fit_H1H2.exp.re<-cfa(model=model_H1H2.exp.re,
              data=dat2019,
              missing="fiml")
```

### Results from the exploratory model

```{r}
round(inspect(fit_H1H2.re,"fit")
      [c("npar","df","chisq","pvalue","cfi","tli","rmsea","srmr")],3)

round(inspect(fit_H1H2.exp.re,"fit")
      [c("npar","df","chisq","pvalue","cfi","tli","rmsea","srmr")],3)
```

The fit of the model is improved by additional residual correlation.

Retest Hypotheses 1 and 2

Print standardized estimates to test the difference between correlations

```{r}
std.est_H1H2.exp<-standardizedsolution(fit_H1H2.exp.re)
std.est_H1H2.exp[std.est_H1H2.exp$op==":=" | 
               std.est_H1H2.exp$op=="~~" & 
               std.est_H1H2.exp$lhs!=std.est_H1H2.exp$rhs,]

#save to a file
export(std.est_H1H2.exp[std.est_H1H2.exp$op!="~1",1:8],
           "../results/TableS1_Overall_H1H2.exp_standardized_estimates.xlsx",
       overwrite=T)
```

The results are virtually identical to those without the additional residual correlation. 

H1.exp: There is very strong (.932, p < .001) correlation between VAA-LR and CS-LR, and it is notably stronger (difference in correlations .462, p < .001) than the strongest of correlations between different dimensions (.470 between VAA_LR and VAA_GT, p < .001)

H2.exp: There is very strong (.990, p < .001) correlation between VAA-GT and CS-GT, and it is notably stronger (difference in correlations .520, p < .001) than the strongest of correlations between different dimensions (.470 between VAA_LR and VAA_GT, p < .001)

\newpage

## H5

H5. Left-Right self-placement in the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS) is positively associated with Left-Right as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). This association is stronger than the association between placement of an imagined party voter in the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS) and Left-Right as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs).

## H3 and H4

H3. Within-party placement on Left-Right as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is positively associated with within-party placement on Left-Right as computed from responses to the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS). This association is stronger than any within-party associations between the Left-Right and GAL-TAN dimensions.

H4. Within-party placement on GAL-TAN as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is positively associated with within-party placement on GAL-TAN as computed from responses to the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS). This association is stronger than any within-party associations between the Left-Right and GAL-TAN dimensions.

ICC1 gives the proportion (%) of variance that is between the parties (ICC2 is the reliability of the group means). There is quite a lot of between-party variance, but the responses are not entire defined by party either.

### Exploratory analysis for H3 and H4: Seek misspecification to improve the overall model fit

Residual correlations

```

There were two misspecified residual correlation.

One was between VAA-LR items (same misspecification as was found for H1 and H2)
H25. Public services should be outsourced more than they are now for private companies and y19. Public authorities should be the main provider of social and healthcare services (r.) 

The other misspecification was between C2a. Immigrants should adapt to Finnish habits and C2f. People who break the law should be punished more severely 

Re-specify the model to allow these parameters to be freely estimated

### Exploratory respecification of the model

```{r}
model_H3H4.exp.re<-paste0(model_H3H4.re,
                      "h25~~y19\n",

              data=dat2019.gmc,
              missing="fiml")

### Results from the exploratory model

## H6 with group mean centered observed variables

H6. Within-party placement on Left-Right as computed from responses to the pre-election public Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) is positively associated with within-party placement on Left-Right as computed from responses to the privately administered post-election Candidate Survey (CS). This association is stronger than any within-party associations between the Left-Right and GAL-TAN dimensions. 

### Add placement variables and their correlations with latent factors to the model used for H3 and H4

Model already includes the three preregistered correlations

```{r}

model_H6<-paste0(model_H3H4.re,

                 "VAA_LR~~r.ideal.LR*IP_LR\n",
                 "test.H6:=r.self.LR-r.ideal.LR\n")

                mis.rescor_H6$decision.pow=="EPC:M") %>%

```

Same misspecifications as there were for model for H3 and H4

Add to the model

```{r}
